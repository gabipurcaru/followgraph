            >
              Followgraph looks up all the people you follow on Mastodon, and
              then the people <em>they</em> follow. Then it sorts them by the
              number of mutuals, or otherwise by how popular those accounts are.
              <br />
              It then shows the list with Mastodon links to follow them.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Do I need to grant Followgraph any permissions?">
              Not at all! Followgraph uses public APIs to fetch potential people
              you can follow on Mastodon. In fact, it only does inauthenticated
              network requests to various Mastodon instances.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Help! The search got stuck.">
              Don&apos;t worry. The list of suggestions will load in 30 seconds
              or so. Sometimes it gets stuck because one or more of the queries
              made to Mastodon time out. This is not a problem, because the rest
              of the queries will work as expected.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Why don't I see any results?">
              There could be a few reasons:
              <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
                <li>
                  Followgraph only works if your list of follows is public. If
                  you&apos;ve opted to hide your social graph in your Mastodon
                  preferences, you will not see any results here.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to the high volume of requests, sometimes Mastodon
                  throttles this tool. If that&apos;s the case, try again a bit
                  later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make sure you have no typos in the Mastodon handle, and make
                  sure you follow at least a few people to seed the search.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="How can I contribute with suggestions?">
              Click the &quot;Fork me on Github&quot; link on the top right, and
              open up an issue.
            </FAQItem>

            <FAQItem title="Why is this not a core Mastodon feature?">
              Well, maybe it should be. In the meantime, you can use this
              website.
